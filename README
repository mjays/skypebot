A proof-of-concept Skype chatbot.

REQUIRES: Skype4Py Python module: 'easy_install skype4py'
	  Skype desktop application from http://www.skype.com

Tested on OS X 10.8.2 with Skype 6.2.0.1117.

TO RUN:
Since Skype4Py requires a running instance of the dektop client. Also, Skype4Py requires to be run with 32bit Python.
To force Python to run in 32bit mode, please follow [these instructions](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/python.1.html).

1) Start up Skype & login to an account. This will be the bot's voice.
2) Since the Skype Desktop API on OS X does not support ActiveChats(), please run chatfinder.py, copy the SkypeHandle you want the bot to attach to, and copy the handle into the array in line 166 in skypebot.py
3) Open a console window and run 'python skypebot.py'

Volia!
